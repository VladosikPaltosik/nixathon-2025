Welcome to Kingdom wars!
Kingdom wars is a strategic multiplayer game where each tower fights for itself. Every player starts with:
❤️ 100 Health Points
🪙 20 Coins

🎯 The goal: survive, negotiate, and defeat all opponents

💰 Resources:

After each NEGOTIATION phase you receive
🪙 +20 coins (based on tower level)

You can spend your coins on:
⚔️ Troops (1 coin = 1 soldier)
🛡️Armour (1 coin = 1 armour = destroys 1 enemy soldier)
🏰 Tower upgrade (50 coins = level 1 upgrade,
88 coins = level 2 upgrade …and so on (see tooltip))

Plan your coins carefully — every coin counts!

🔄 Turn overview
Each game lasts up to 25 turns, each turn is divided into 2 phases:
🤝 Negotiation
⚔️ Combat

You can observe game progress in the upper-right corner of the screen: phase, times for turn, turn, fatigue info.

💬 Negotiation phase
⏱️ Duration: 20 seconds

During the Negotiation Phase, you can communicate with other players:
🤝 Offer friendship
⚔️ Send a threat of attack — click the flag that matches the opponent’s tower to announce which tower you plan to attack

⚠️ Note: You can send only one negotiation action per opponent

You’ll see all negotiation messages from this phase only in the next phase. Meanwhile, to choose allies or identify aggressors, you can rely on the Combat Log

⚔️ Combat Log

Review each encounter from the Combat Phase. See who attacked whom, how many troops were sent, and get the full picture before planning your next epic move

⚔️ Combat phase
⏱️ Duration: 20 seconds

During Combat, you allocate coins and troops to attack and defend.
⚔️ Decide how many troops to send to each opponent
🛡️ Decide how many coins to spend on defense
🏰 Upgrade your tower to increase your income in future turns

You will always see your planned expenditure and how many coins are left
⚠️ Note: You can adjust your coin allocation until the Combat Phase ends

📜 Diplomacy Log

Review your sent and received messages to keep track of your alliances. Monitoring your private conversations helps you spot threats and plan your next attack.

⚔️ Duel mode
When two players remain, the game enters Duel Mode:
🛑 Negotiations stop
⚔️ Only direct combat remains

⚠️ Duel Mode does not apply to games with AIs

⚡ Fatigue system
💥 Fatigue starts after 25 combats, or after the 5th turn when only 2 players remain.

1st turn after fatigue = 10 damage,
2nd = 20 damage,
3rd = 40 damage,
4th = 80 damage
The system speeds up the game, increases damage each turn, and prevents endless standoffs.

You can track the fatigue damage in the top-right corner
